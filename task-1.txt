    Miranda Klockars - studying Interactive Media in Mediapolis, TAMK


Right now I'm stressed out about all the projects we have this spring that started recently, but also excited to get them done and learn along the way. 
On my free time I draw a lot, read books and knit and I also like taking walks in the forest :D 

I'm interested in web design and graphic design overall and I really like playing with colors and layouts and making things look aesthetically pleasing.

The only experience I have with web development is what I've learned since last autumn when I started this study path. We had some introduction to programming and now that I'm in this Web and App Design minor I've learned a bit about the basics, from html, to js, to css, to wordpress and databases.


When I grow up I'd like to be a graphic designer, maybe even have my own company or work for anyone who might need the service, a website or something similar.


    I have to say that I'm a bit scared about this course, or at least I was (when things were not working out), but now if all goes well, maybe it won't be so bad. I do like the idea of creating my own applications that works and looks nice, but like I said I prefer websites, or I guess I simply prefer the design aspect of things - not the programming as much, but it's fun to learn it nonetheless.
